In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves using `self` incorrectly within a class's initializer (`init` method).  If you accidentally access or modify instance variables before they've been fully initialized in `init`, you might encounter unexpected behavior or crashes. This is because the instance variables might not have been assigned their default values yet.

For example:

```objectivec
- (instancetype)initWithName:(NSString *)name {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        _name = name; // Correct: Assigning after self check
        [self doSomethingWith: _name]; // Incorrect: _name may not be fully initialized 
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)doSomethingWith:(NSString *)aName{
    //Use aName
}
```
The `doSomethingWith:` method might crash or produce unexpected results because `_name` might not have been fully initialized at that point if `name` is nil or empty and  there's no default value.  The correct sequence is to ensure all instance variables are set before using them within the initializer.
